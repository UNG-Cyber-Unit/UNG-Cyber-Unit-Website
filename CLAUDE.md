# CyberUnit @ UNG — working notes

Interactive cybersecurity education site on **Cloudflare Workers + D1**. Canonical
entry point is **`worker.js`** (routing, API, auth, security headers, per-page SEO
injection). `server.js` is a legacy Express prototype — not deployed, ignore it.

## Deployment
- **Pushing to `main` auto-deploys** via GitHub Actions (`wrangler deploy`). There is
  no separate deploy step — a push *is* a deploy.
- **Schema changes must be migrated on the remote D1 *before* the deploy lands**, or
  the worker will query a column/table that doesn't exist in prod and error. Apply to
  both local and remote:
  - `npx wrangler d1 execute DB --local  --command "<ALTER/CREATE ...>"`
  - `npx wrangler d1 execute DB --remote --command "<ALTER/CREATE ...>"`

## Gotchas when adding things

**Adding a new HTML page (`public/*.html`):**
- Cloudflare serves matching static files *before* the worker, so they bypass the
  worker's security headers (CSP, `X-Frame-Options`, `nosniff`). **Add the page's
  route to `run_worker_first` in `wrangler.toml`** so it gets those headers. Do NOT
  add CSS/JS/image paths there — routing assets through the worker breaks their MIME
  type. Pages only.
- **Never write inline `<script>` blocks.** The CSP `script-src` is `'self'` only (no
  hash/nonce/unsafe-inline), so inline scripts are blocked. Put all JS in a
  `public/js/*.js` file and load it with `<script src="/js/…">` — same-origin scripts
  are allowed automatically and need no CSP changes ever.
- If it should rank in search: **add its path to the sitemap** (the `paths` array in
  the `/sitemap.xml` route in `worker.js`) and give it a unique `<title>` +
  `<meta name="description">`.
- If it's a private/app page (auth-gated): add `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`
  and do NOT list it in the sitemap.

**Adding a topic:** add it to the `topics` array in `worker.js`. The sitemap, the
per-topic `<title>`/description/OG/`BreadcrumbList`, and the homepage grid all derive
from that array automatically. Two things that do NOT auto-update:
- **The Beginner Pathway** (`/start`): a new topic won't appear until you add its id to a
  stage's `topicIds` in the `pathwayStages` array.
- **Topic hook/takeaway**: add an entry in the `topicFraming` map (keyed by topic id) so
  the topic page gets its mentor intro + key takeaway.

**Homepage topic grid** and the **`/start` pathway** are server-rendered by the worker
(`homeTopicCards()` on `path === '/'`, `pathwayHtml()` on `path === '/start'`) so crawlers
see the content without JS. `main.js`/`start.js` then enhance with per-user progress and
leave the server-rendered cards intact if that fetch fails. Both share the `topicCard()`
"module" component.

## Verify before committing
Run `npx wrangler dev` and actually exercise the change (repo pattern: drive it in
headless Chrome via puppeteer-core). For DB-touching work, seed and clean rows with
`wrangler d1 execute DB --local`, and delete any test users/rows afterward.
