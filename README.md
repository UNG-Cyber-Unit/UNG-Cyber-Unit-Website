# CyberUnit @ UNG

An interactive cybersecurity education website for the **University of North Georgia Boar's Head Brigade Cyber Unit**.

Covers beginner cybersecurity topics with quizzes, an about page with the unit's org structure and sister organization (CyberHawks), an SOP link, user accounts with progress tracking, and instructor-hosted live Quiz Rooms with public/private visibility and free-response grading.

Built with **Cloudflare Workers**, **D1**, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

## Quiz Rooms

Instructors can host live quizzes separate from the self-paced topic quizzes above:

- **Question sources** — build questions manually in the Instructor Panel (card-based builder), or import a `.csv`/`.json` file. Both support two question types:
  - **Multiple choice** — 2–4 answers, auto-graded on submit.
  - **Free response** — student types an answer; scored as *pending* until an instructor manually grades it correct/incorrect from the results page. The attempt shows a tentative score in the meantime.
- **Visibility** — a room is **Private** (default, join by code only) or **Public** (also listed for any logged-in member to browse and join on the **Join Room** page, at `/quiz`).
- **Instructor results view** — per-student roster with score, a "N pending" badge when free-response grading is outstanding, a **Review Answers** button (jumps straight to the grading controls, which also show the question's grading notes), a **Reset Attempt** button (lets a student retake the quiz), and CSV export.
- **Room codes** are `XXXX-XXXX`, generated with a CSPRNG.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Runtime | Cloudflare Workers |
| Database | Cloudflare D1 (`schema.sql`) |
| Static assets | Cloudflare Workers Assets (`./public`) |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML / CSS / JS |
| Auth | Custom JWT (HS256) + PBKDF2 password hashing, HttpOnly `SameSite=Strict` session cookie |
| Input validation | Server-side length caps on all Quiz Room fields, 1MB question-file cap, CSV/formula-injection sanitization on exported reports, parameterized SQL throughout |
| Room privacy | Room codes are 32⁸ (~2⁴⁰) CSPRNG values; unknown/closed/expired codes all return an identical 404 (no existence oracle); failed code lookups are rate-limited per IP (20 / 10 min) to block brute-force enumeration |
| Deployment | Wrangler CLI, auto-deployed on push to `main` via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) |

> **Note on `server.js`:** this was the original Express-based prototype and predates the account system, D1 database, and Quiz Rooms feature. It is **not used in production** — `wrangler deploy` runs `worker.js` exclusively. It's kept around only as a lightweight way to preview the static topic pages with `npm start`/`npm run dev`, and does not reflect current functionality (no login, progress tracking, admin/instructor panels, or Quiz Rooms).

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) (`npm install -g wrangler`)

### Setup

```bash
npm install
```

### Run locally (full app — recommended)

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8787`, backed by D1 and the full auth/Quiz Rooms feature set.

### Run locally (static preview only, via `server.js`)

```bash
npm start        # or: npm run dev (nodemon, auto-reload)
```

Serves only the static topic pages on Express — no auth, no database, no Quiz Rooms. Useful for a quick content-only preview without Wrangler.

---

## Deployment

Deployment is automated: pushing to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which runs `wrangler deploy` using the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` repo secret.

To deploy manually:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

Requires a Cloudflare account with Workers enabled. Authenticate first with `wrangler login`.
